## Idea and Purpose
Allow organizations to manage their user's calender automatically through client applications on multi-platform devices. Users can subscribe to a group and their feed will be mereged with the user's own feed as well as other groups to manage time as well as over lapping conflicts.

## Usage
User downloads thrid or first party client. The client checks and revieves new calender updates and announcents broadcasted to the users of a group. The group is managed on a server and has a dashboard to manage, and send messages to their users.

## Design & Structure
Groups and their dashboards are hosted on a seperate dashboard. Dashboards make edits to something similar to an RSS feed. Clients parse the feed into pretty things.
